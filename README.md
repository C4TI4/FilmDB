# FilmDB
Database for films and TV shows 

# $> Project requirements:
The actual theme for your frontend is of your choice. It can be a blog, a movie catalogue, a library, etc.<br>
You need to use [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) (or another CMS of your choice ie. Strapi) to create and model your data. Think about what kinds of entities you need to have (ie. a blog could have posts, and authors), and what kind of data is relevant to these entities (a blog post should have a title, description, publish date, etc...)<br>
That data will be used to fill your page! Fetching from Contentful is best done with the [Contentful library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/contentful)
Remember to keep your CMS credentials in .env.local files to avoid sensitive data leaks ðŸ˜‰
<br>

# You should aim for at least 2 to 3 pages for your app:
Landing page<br>
Page display of a single entity (like a single blog post, or product)<br>
*Third page content is optional.* A few ideas: a search result page, or a page to add a new resource to *Contentful*. Your pick!<br>


# Presentations will take place on next week's **Friday (13th Oct).**

The examples from the demo are up on our repo already :3

**Some goodies:**
Little overview on the [concept of headless CMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_8cplBi_gE) again (watch only the first couple minutes. He goes into a specific CMS called Sanity, and it might just get you confused ðŸ˜‰ ) 
Here's some info on handling [environmental variables](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html) and here some [more](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files), from Vite's documentation.
